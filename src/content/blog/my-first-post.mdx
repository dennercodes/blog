# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post using **MDX**! I can write content in Markdown and even use React components inside my posts.

## Code Example

```typescript
function greet(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

## Features

- Syntax highlighting
- Support for React components
- Frontmatter for metadata
- Automatic slug generation
- Table of contents support

You can also use _italic_ text and create [links](https://nextjs.org).
